This is my first post written in **Markdown**. It's much easier to write this way!

The new `index.html` file on my site automatically fetches these `.md` files, uses a library to convert them to HTML, and displays them.

### Features
* Simple bullet points
* **Bold** and *italic* text
* Code blocks

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
}
