I decided to go through the TryHackMe Chocolate Factory room. Here is a walkthrough of what I did.

### Part 1: Getting the key

Question one is to find the answer key as shown below.

I will start by connecting to the VPN Server with OpenVPN.

This is a screen recording of me doing exactly that

As you can see it is quite easy to do so even if the AttackBox seems tempting.

I will now start with a simple Nmap scan

While nothing interesting, the http port does seem interesting, so let's check it out.

I will need to go to http://10.10.30.125 as that is my given target IP.

I can't really do anything with this. I tried a few basic credentials like 'Admin' 'Admin' and even tried SQL Injections but nothing. 
Looking at the terminal output I see an FTP service. I will try using the Nmap Banner command command and see the result.

I will now run the following command: nmap --script=banner 10.10.30.125 -p21-125 -v

Well that was a waste of time. All I got is a welcome message :/

Remember the original scan I did. Well I tried every port listed and got an interesting result from port 113 when doing a Netcat scan.

This is great progress from before.

I will go to the following address as in: http://10.10.30.125/key_rev_key

Let's see what happens!

Well what happens if I extract the file.

And there is the answer. Submitting it shows it is correct.
